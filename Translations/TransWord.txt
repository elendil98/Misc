"The Mini-Map is an overhead view of the entire map. Currently the mini-map is being flashed with the two camps you need to help."



"White flashes inform you of objective locations. While a red flash would indicate where your forces are being attacked."



"On the Palantir is the Objectives Menu. Click on the Objective button now to see what your current objective is."



"There are two types of Objectives, Main Objectives and Bonus Objectives. Main Objectives appear in white text and need to be accomplished in order to complete a mission."



"Bonus Objectives appear in green text. You may choose to complete them, but they won't count against you if you don't."

"All the camps are now secure and the road between them is safe."



"We need to set up a larger camp, but we'll need a great deal of land with which to do so."



"Up ahead is such an expanse of land, but it is held by Spider Lairs."



"Destroy those lairs and we should be able to establish a new camp here."



"When a lair is destroyed, it will leave behind rubble. You will also need to destroy the rubble or else the lair will rebuild itself."

"We'll need a fortress. To build a fortress left click on the fortress button which is flashing now."



"In order to place down a building, left click anywhere on the land. For the purposes of this camp, place your fortress on the spotlight."



"Fortresses can produce more builders should the need arise. Fortresses can also build Heroes, such as our Lord Boromir."



"They also have upgrades available to them, but we'll get to that another time."



"Now that we have a fortress built, we'll need an economy to fund our base."



"Select a builder and have it build a farm on the spotlight in the upper left. You'll notice that as you're placing the farm it has a percentage attached to it. This percentage will tell you how productive it will be given its current placement on land."



"Mountains, oceans, rivers, or other impassable areas will take away from the productivity of a farm. The resources our farms produce can be tracked by the number at the bottom left of the Palantir."



"Farms contribute to your army's command point limit. So the more farms you build, the more battalions you can command."



"Command Points are tracked by the number at the bottom right of the Palantir."



"Select the builder again and build a barracks on the next spotlight."



"The barracks will be able to produce soldiers and tower guard."



"Build an archery range on the other spotlight."



"The archery range will be able to produce archers and Ithilien rangers."



"Now our base will need fortifications."



"In order to fortify our base, we'll need to set up wall spans. Wall spans begin with wall hubs, which can be built from either our fortress or from our builders."



"In order to build them from the fortress, click on the build plot highlighted."



"Click on the wall hub button to begin building it now."

"To build it, left click on the ground at the spotlight."



"Click on the wall hub you just built in the spotlight and build another wall off to the south. Another spotlight is set up showing you where your wall should end."



"Select the next build plot highlighted on the fortress and build a wall span to the spotlight to the right. Then build to the next spotlight in the north."



"Next we will need to build wall defenses."



"You may upgrade a wall with structures such as arrow towers, trebuchets, gates or wall hubs."



"What we really need right now are the trebuchets. Select any wall segment and build a trebuchet upgrade on it."



"Build 2 battalions of Gondor soldiers from the barracks."



"Now build two battalions of Gondor archers from the archery range."



"We'll need a Hero to lead our troops. Heroes can be purchased from the fortress. If your Heroes should fall in battle, they can be revived from the fortress as well."



"To summon a Hero, select your fortress and click on the Heroes button. This will bring up a menu of all the current Heroes you're allowed to build. Right now Boromir is residing in our fortress."



"Click on his portrait to summon him."



"Heroes in general have an array of special powers and abilites that make them unique and vital for a strong army. Select Boromir now."



"You will find a Hero's abilities on the palantir. Some are passive abilities which are always enabled such as Boromir's leadership ability."



"Other powers can be set to autocast by right clicking its button in the palantir. You will see its outline sparkle when this is enabled."



"Right click on Boromir's Horn of Gondor ability to set it to autocast."



"Our army is built and Gondor's new fortress is complete. You've learned all the basics of building and controlling a base and an army."



"SCOUT: The goblins, they're here! A large force has gathered and is moving towards this very spot."



"You will have to defend this base as you've done before with the camps."



"Remember, select your army and right click on the enemy units to issue attack orders. You can select one battalion at a time and issue them attack orders to specific enemy battalions."



"Victory is ours! Great job my lord! That ought to send those Goblins back to their caves."

"Destroy the goblin base."



"Welcome back to the White Mountains. As you can see we've been very busy here, \n but the goblin attacks have yet to stop."



"The goblins seem to be coming from across the river. I suggest \n we take the fight to their base!"



"Before we move forward, I would like to teach you some \n of the tactics that our battalions have been working on."



"Each battalion can enter a particular attack mode, or what we refer to as stances. These stances can boost their power or defense. Click on the Gondor soldier battalion in the spotlight."



"The stances button is located on the palantir. If you click on it, it will bring up a menu with 3 stances to choose from."



"The Battle Stance is the default stance for all units and renders no bonuses or penalties to a unit's abilities."



"The Aggressive Stance will increase a unit's offensive capabilities while decreasing their defensive capabilities."



"The Hold Ground Stance will greatly increase a unit's defensive capabilities while decreasing their offensive capabilities."



"Set the battalion you have selected into its Aggressive Stance by clicking on the Aggressive Stance button."



"Now let's have our army form up into a battle line."



"Select multiple battalions and move your cursor over to the spotlight."



"Now press and hold both the right and left mouse buttons and drag your mouse. You'll notice that a formation preview will display on the ground. Once you release the mouse buttons, your units will form up into this battle line."



"We must take our army across the river and over to the enemy's base. In order to do so we will need a shipwright."



"There's a shipwright to the East of here along the river."



"Move a battalion to the shipwright and capture it. Remember to capture it by right clicking on the flag while having a battalion selected."



"Selecting the shipwright will bring up options of different types of vessels you may purchase."



"The transport will ferry your troops across large bodies of water."



"Battleships will help destroy enemy ships that impede your way."



"Gondor has sent naval reinforcments. Let's join up with them. Select the shipwright and click on the Transport to begin building one."



"Now select your battalion and right click on the Transport. You'll notice that your cursor changes to a garrison icon. Other structures in Middle-earth can be garrisoned as well, so keep an eye out for that icon."



"Great, now move your transport into the spotlight to join up with the rest of the Gondor convoy."



"GONDOR OFFICER: A fell beast! Watch out!"



"GONDOR OFFICER: It destroyed one of the Transports! Hurry, get to the beach quickly!"



"GONDOR OFFICER: Engage those Corsair ships! Send them to the bottom of the river!"



"In order to deploy your units from a Transport, select the Transport and give it a move order on land."



"There's one of their camps up ahead. Issue an Attack-move order and that should take care of them."



"To issue an Attack-move order, select your army and press the A key on your keyboard. This will change your cursor to an Attack-move cursor."



"Then, right click on the ground in the spotlight behind the camp. This will send your army on a path of destruction to that point, killing every enemy they encounter."



"It appears as though the goblins have retreated over that wall. Unfortunately goblins are able to scale walls by climbing them whereas we are not, nor do we have any siege weapons to take down those walls."



"We'll have to call in for greater powers to help us progress."



"At your disposal is a list of powers that can be purchased from the Evenstar icon located on the palantir. Click on the Evenstar icon now."



"As you can see, all the powers are tiered, which means you have to purchase the lower costing powers in order to access the more expensive powers."



"In order to purchase a power, you must have an amount of power points equal to or greater than the number associated with that power."



"Go ahead and purchase the Arrow Volley and Earthquake powers. They are currently the only powers available to buy."



"To exit, click the Accept button at the bottom of the screen."



"Every time you buy a new power, it will appear on the left hand side of your screen just above the palantir."



"Now back to the battle. Left click on the Arrow Volley power and move your cursor over the goblins."



"To use the power, left click on the ground."



"To use the power, left click on the ground."


"Keep in mind that certain powers such as Arrow Volley can only be cast in areas that are visible to you."



"Now to get past these walls. Unfortunately the gate is in disrepair and cannot be opened, so we'll have to destroy these walls."



"The Earthquake power will deal a significant amount of damage to these walls and should be enough to clear our path."



"Left click on the Earthquake power now and left click underneath those walls to cast it."



"Continue north along the path and be wary of any camps you encounter."



"ITHILIEN RANGER: M'lord, we are glad you have come. We've been keeping an eye on this Goblin camp and have set up a trap for them. All we need to do is set the forest ablaze around them and it should spread into their camp."



"Fire has become a valuable asset as of late. Unfortunately in our enemy's hands it could be a serious danger."



"Select the rangers who have joined you and have them volley their arrows into the spotlights. This will start a fire there and you'll be able to watch it spread into the enemy's base."



"That was the last of their camps, their main base is just to the west."



"There's their main base. It appears as though those tunnels are how they've been traveling through these mountains."



"One thing to note about their tunnels is that when destroyed, you must also destroy the rubble they leave behind. Otherwise the tunnels will spring forth once more and the Goblins will be able to use them yet again."



"If we completely destroy their tunnels and their fortress, that should put a stop to them infesting these mountains once and for all."



"Their fortress is killing our army. Use your Earthquake power again on their fortress and it should take down their defenses."



"Victory is ours! The goblin threat has been eliminated once and for all in this mountain pass. Minas Tirith will be pleased to hear of our victory and may sleep safely knowing this pass is once again controlled by Gondor."



"And you, milord, are now ready to vanquish more evil from Middle-earth. Take with you all that you have learned and try a campaign, a skirmish versus the AI, or a multiplayer match online against your friends!"

"Tutorial Complete"



"Congratulations! You have successfully completed the War of the Ring tutorial."



"Welcome To the War Of The Ring."



"The War Of The Ring is a turn-based strategic game that is played on the living world map."



"Territories that are under your control will be highlighted with your color and territories claimed by your enemies will be highlighted with their respective colors."



"To zoom in and out of the map, push the mouse wheel forward and backward. To scroll through the map, push your cursor towards the edge of the screen to move in that direction."



"A single turn is divided into 3 phases, Tactical, Battle, and Retreat."



"In the Tactical Phase, you will make all your strategic choices regarding the expansion of your kingdom. Structure Construction, Unit Training, and Army Movement are all decided in this phase."



"You can construct new buildings on any open build plot in a territory you control."



"There are four basic structure classes to choose from, Fortress, Barracks, Armoury, and Farm."



"To build a new structure, left click on a build plot to bring up the menu that shows all the available buildings that can be constructed. Then left click on the building you want to construct."



"All structures cost a number of turns to build and only one structure per territory can be under construction at a time."



"In the Battle Phase, all conflicts between opposing players are fought. A battle occurs when at least one of your armies and one of your enemy’s armies end up in the same territory after the planned moves are executed from the tactical phase."



"In the Retreat phase, all Hero armies that are defeated in battle must withdraw to safe territories."



"Command points represent the number of troops you are allowed to train. You can not build more troops than you have command points. Your world command point limit indicates the current population of your empire that inhabits the whole of Middle-earth."



"You can train new units at any one of your barracks."



"There are four basic unit classes to choose from, Soldier, Archer, Pikeman, and Cavalry."



"To train a new battalion, left click on a barracks to bring up the menu that shows all the available units that can be trained. Then left click on the unit you want to train."



"All battalions cost a number of turns to train and only one set of troops per barracks can be in training at a time."



"All armies are allowed to move to only 1 adjacent territory from their current location per turn. However, the choice of an army’s destination depends on the type of army that is being moved."



"There are 2 types of armies under your command, Garrison Armies, and Hero Armies."



"A garrison army is composed of all the troop battalions that reside in a territory."



"To examine the composition of an army, left click to select an army. Then left click on the Selection Details button on the Palantir at the lower left of the screen."



"Garrison armies are used to defend the lands of your empire and can only move between territories that you control."



"To order a garrison army to join a Hero army, left click to select a garrison army. Then right click on the desired Hero army to have the battalions of your selected army merge with the Hero forces."



"A Hero army is a group of battalions that are commanded by a special Hero that has the ability to lead troops into battle."



"To order a Hero army to move into a territory, left click to select a Hero army. Then right click on the desired territory to send your selected Hero army to that location."



"Active battles are indicated by an animated battle marker. To settle the encounter, left click the battle marker."



"This battle screen shows you detailed information about your forces and the enemy forces involved in skirmish in the contested territory."



"You may have up to 3 methods for handling an encounter, Auto-Resolve, Realtime, or Retreat."



"Only the Hero army leaders survive from a lost battle and have the ability to retreat."



"To order a Hero army to retreat, left click to select a defeated Hero army. Then right click on a friendly territory to send your army to that location."



"Good Luck!"




"The War Of The Ring is a turn-based strategic game of territory conquest, resource management, and epic confrontations that takes place over the lands of Middle-earth."



"The game is played on the living world map."



"The game is played as a series of turns that are taken simultaneously by all players."



"Each phase must be completed by all players before the game continues to the next phase. When all phases have been completed, the turn is over and a new turn begins."



"First, you will focus on structure construction in the tactical phase of this turn."



"There are four basic structure classes to choose from, Fortress, Barracks, Armoury, and Farm. Each structure class provides a necessary function to a growing empire."



"Select the open build plot in Cair Andros and build a barracks."



"Once all players have completed the tactical phase, the strategic choices of each player are revealed on the living world map, and the game continues to the next phase."



"Since you are not going to construct any more buildings at this time, press the End Phase button to finish the tactical phase."



"Since there are not any conflicts at this time, the game will continue to the next phase."



"In the Retreat phase, all armies lead by Heroes that are defeated in battle must withdraw to safe territories."



"Since you do not have any defeated Hero armies at this time, the game will continue to the next phase."



"Now that all phases have been finished, a single turn in War Of The Ring is completed. A new turn begins and you start again at the tactical phase."



"The barracks you started to build in the previous turn has been completed and its abilities are now available for you to use."



"Next, you will concentrate on unit training in the tactical phase of this turn."



"Command points represent the number of troops you are allowed to train. You can not build more troops than you have command points."



"Your world command point limit indicates the current population of your empire that inhabits the whole of Middle-earth. It is displayed at the top left corner of the screen."



"There are four basic unit classes to choose from, Soldier, Archer, Pikeman, and Cavalry. Each unit class has their own distinct traits and capabilities when fighting the other unit classes."



"Select the barracks in Cair Andros and train a battalion of troops."



"Since you are not going to train any more units at this time, press the End Phase button to finish the tactical phase."



"Again, no conflicts have occurred, so the game will pass through the battle and retreat phases."



"The battalion you started to train in the previous turn has been completed and is now available for you to command into battle."



"Finally, you will learn army movement in the tactical phase of this turn."



"Select the garrison army in Cair Andros and examine its composition by displaying the details panel."



"Observe that the battalion you just trained appears here."



"From this panel, detailed stats for each battalion in an army can be seen, and commands to the individual battalions themselves can be given."



"Garrison armies are used to defend the lands of your empire and can only move between territories that you control. Thus, they cannot takeover neutral territories or invade enemy territories on their own. However, a garrison army can join with a Hero army to strengthen a Hero army's attacking forces."



"Order the garrison army in Cair Andros to join Aragorn's army in Rohan."



"A Hero army is a group of battalions that are commanded by a special Hero that has the ability to lead troops into battle. They can not only move between territories that you control, but are also used to expand the lands of your kingdom by conquering neutral territories and invading enemy territories."



"Select Aragorn's army in Rohan and move into The Dead Marshes."



"Since you are not going to move any more armies at this time, press the End Phase button to finish the tactical phase."



"This time during the battle phase there are encounters with the enemy that must be resolved."



"Select the battle marker in Osgiliath to resolve the conflict."



"This battle screen shows you detailed information about your forces and the enemy forces involved in the skirmish in the contested territory."



"Selecting Auto-Resolve will calculate the winner of the battle automatically based on factors such as the size, unit composition, and experience of the forces involved."



"Selecting Realtime will allow you to manually fight the battle in the disputed territory."



"Selecting Retreat will allow you to withdraw your forces from the conflict before the battle starts. However, your retreating armies may lose some units in the process."



"When the battle has been resolved, ownership of the territory will be awarded to the winner."



"For the purposes of the tutorial, all battles will be auto-resolved."



"Press the Auto-Resolve button to fight the battle in Osgiliath."



"You lost this battle, but not the war. Don't give up."



"During the Battle phase there may be multiple conflicts. Each conflict is resolved one at a time."



"Select the battle marker in The Dead Marshes to resolve the conflict."



"Once all battles have been resolved, the battle phase is over."



"Press the End Phase button to finish the battle phase."



"Since one of your Hero armies has been defeated in battle, you must withdraw that army to a friendly territory to recover. Only the Hero army leaders survive from a lost battle and have the ability to retreat."



"Select Boromir's army in Osgiliath and retreat to one of your territories."



"Once all retreat orders have been issued, the retreat phase is over."



"Press the End Phase button to finish the retreat phase."



"The turn is over, but the battle for Middle-earth has just begun."



"This concludes the War Of The Ring tutorial. Follow these simple guidelines and you will soon dominate the whole of Middle-earth."

But through the encompassing darkness, there was still hope that Heroes would arise to challenge Sauron."

"*It’s a traaap!"



"*They're invading the shores now!! We may be stretched too thin!"



"*We have no defenses there!"



"*The gulls will feast upon pirate flesh tonight!"



"*Ay! We couldn’t let our friends have ALL the fun now!"



"*The heart of the Dwarf is a restless one! When the battle calls, we answer!"



"*It's the Dwarves! They've come to help us!"



"*The Dwarves! The Dwarves have come!"



"*Dwarves, Ready yourselves! We must hold the shore at all costs!"



"*Hold your ground! We must not falter!"



"*Push them back into the sea! "



"*The town is on fire!"



"*Yes, it seems that we have arrived not a moment too soon! TO ARMS!"



"*Dwarves! We must defend this town with all our strength. The elves may not arrive in time!"



"*King Dáin! You're a welcome sight, friend!"



"*Dwarven friends! Just in time! The armies of Mordor will overrun us soon!"



"*King Dáin! You've made it!"



"*King Dáin! You've made it! We've already set up a small base."



"*At last, our King arrives!"



"*Sire, do you think the elves will come and help?"



"*No time for such worries... To battle!!"



"*Curse them! They've destroyed our ships!"



"*It's a troll!"



"*Let us take this area and prepare a counter attack!"



"*There is a dock to the South. We should capture it and take the fight to them!"



"*Mûmakil!! There are too many!"



"*Hold steady, Dwarves. These giant beasts cannot last forever!"



"*The catapults! They fire in waves."



"*Use this wreckage for shelter, then advance when it's clear!"



"*So much water! We weren't made for this kind of thing."



"*Ack! Enough of the water already!"



"*This is why we dwarves build our homes in solid earth!"



"*Ye gods! What in Dáin's name is that thing?!!"



"*Ah, good solid ground at last!"



"*We MUST destroy those Catapults."



"*We have them! Let's put our axes to work now... Yaahh!!"



"*These people are safe for now."



"*We’ve set up a base here. Not much, but it’ll have to do."



"*I don’t trust these waters..."



"*I think I saw something in the water."



"*Ah! A Nazgûl!"



"*There's a mineshaft over here!"



"*We have a mineshaft ready over here!"



"*This mineshaft is in working order!"



"*Dale is the only thing left between the enemy and Mount Erebor. We must defend it."



"*We've set up a fortress in Dale to defend the city."



"*Dale has fallen!"



"*Fall back to the Gate!"



"*Retreat to the mountain!"



"*This fortress should hold them for a while."



"*I've heard that they come out during times of darkness."



"*They're inside the mountain!"



"*Now my dear King…you will die!"



"*It's a traaaap!"



"*The elves! The elves have come!"

"*Let the river flow red with the blood of the easterlings!!"



"*Use the Earthquake! It will rip their buildings down!"



"*Use the Undermine to get behind their lines!"



"*The Demolisher, can take those buildings down."



"*Dwarves! This our last chance! Defend Erebor or die!!"



"*We did it! We killed the hideous Mouth of Sauron!"



"*We will be safe only when ALL of Sauron's forces are destroyed."



"*Elves of the Golden Wood - hear me! We must cast out the Shadow in the Forest! Our Allies from Mirkwood and Erebor will heed our signal! Galadhrim, to battle!"



"*Ah! It's horrible!"



"*I won't go near it!"



"*Our forces flee before the fortress! What dark trickery is THIS?"



"*It is a cruel image of Sauron. It fills their hearts with dread! Today we will crush this evil!"



"*The statue! That's what's causing them to flee - we must destroy it!"



"*It's the likeness of Sauron. It's enchanted with the dark power of Mordor...Destroy it!"



"*It's the likeness of Sauron. It's enchanted with the dark power of Mordor... Destroy it!"



"*There it is! Seize the Signal Fire!"



"*We've done it - The Mirkwood armies will see our signal."



"*King Thranduil has arrived with reinforcements!"



"*The Elves of the Northern Wood will not cower from the Darkness! Elves, Ents - follow my lead!"



"*We've defeated their wretched armies at Erebor. Now we will expel them from these lands for ever!"



"*Take the second Signal Fire! The forces from Erebor await our sign!"



"*It is done! The Dwarves of Erebor should be on their way!"



"*It's King Dáin! He's come to help us!"



"*The Dwarves of the Mountain stand with you on this day! Dwarf and Elf, let us stand united against the Shadow!"



"*The Black Riders have returned - and they lead a great host of Mordor against us!"



"*What? An army of Mordor has emerged from the forest!"



"*We must not stand firm! It is in fear that our enemy seeks to divide us! Elves, Dwarves, and Men, slay the Enemy to the last!"



"*It is done! The great darkness has been purged from these woods! May the valor shown this day endure in song for all the days to follow."



"*The Nazgûl leader must be dealt with!"



"*We must face the Nazgûl leader who commands these armies!"



"*The raid upon Lorien has long been in the waiting."



"*The Elves long have tricked and cursed our forces in these parts. Today, that will end."



"*We must build an army before we raid the Elven city."



"*We're ready. Destroy everything pretty!"



"*Destroy every elf and treehouse in this accursed place!"



"*They have a Giant held captive. Free it and it will help us destroy the Elves!"



"*Another Giant! Our army will grow yet stronger!"



"*Who is that elf?! Such courage must be quelled. Kill him!"



"*That elf leader mocks us! Slay him now!"



"*Their leader Celeborn, must die!"



"*Raze the city to the ground!"



"*It's an ambush! The elves are attacking from the trees!"



"*We can use these mine shafts to move our army through Lorien quickly."



"*Destroy the elven treehouses!"



"*Die, you pretty elves! DIE!"



"*Aim for their heads!"



"*This place reeks of elves! We must be close."



"*Your filth will not spread through this land! Leave now or die!"



"*Send them back to their underworld!"



"*Leave this place, lest it become your grave!"



"*I will die before you set foot upon this sanctuary!"



"*Elves! To Arms! The Enemy is here!"



"*Away!"



"*Do not let them free the Giant!"



"*The Giant! They will release it upon us!"



"*It's too late! The Giant has been freed!"



"*Back to the shadows, Goblin scum!"



"*Feel the sting of our arrows!"



"*The enemy is at our gates! To the defenses!"



"*By the light of the Galadriel, you will all perish!"



"*Celeborn is wounded!"



"*Escape Galadriel! Flee and warn the others!"



"*You shall see my wrath! Minions of Sauron!"



"*We must leave or home. Retreat to the lands north of here!"



"*The elf queen has escaped!"



"*No matter. We will deal with her later."



"*Celeborn is dead!"



"*They've killed Celeborn!"



"*Capture the docks! We'll need it to build more ships!"



"*That's it! The Dock is ours. Now let's get to the Signal Fire!"



"*The Goblin King has an army in the nearby hills and is waiting for us to give him the signal."



"*Capture the Signal Fire, and the Goblin King's army will come and join the assault!"



"*Excellent! Our first catch of the day."



"*The beacon is lit! Our transports gather offshore. Defend them at all costs!"

"*Ahh….the Shire. This day has finally come!! Haehaha!!"



"*Aack!! Who are those ugly people?!"



"*They've come to raid the Shire!"



"*No…no no no. Make it go away!"



"*The hobbits cower in fear. Show them their new homes… in the pits!"



"*Enslave the pests! Put them into the pits!"

"*The trees are attacking us! What IS this place?!"



"*The fire arrows will burn those trees down!"



"*We can land here."



"*Spiderlings! There's too many to fight!"



"*The spiderlings of Mirkwood are said to be Shelob's children, bring her and we can gain their allegience."



"*The spiderlings will fight for us when we summon them!"



"*Now we can summon the spiderlings now to fight for us."



"*It's the Old Forest Road! Build sentry towers at the four key locations... and the Road shall be ours!"



"*Now Elves! Let them fly!"

"*We can capture this hill! "



"*There's too many of them! "



"*Die! My Elven pretties!"



"*You miserable elves! We'll burn you out of those trees!"



"*They're sending out their builders! Don't let them get their towers up!"



"*If they build up all four towers, we will lose the road!"



"*Mirkwood shall be ours!"



"*They're attacking the towers!"



"*We need just one last tower! Hurry you miserable orcs! "



"*The Elves have a tower up, Bring it down!"



"*Hurry! The Elves have two towers up already!"

"*We shall meet them again!"



"*The Dragon Lord lives in these parts. We must seek him out."



"*The Withered Heath has been a battleground for the Dragons and Dwarves for centuries. We can not let the Dwarves get in our way."



"*Destroy all the Dwarven Mine Shafts in the area."



"*Let no dwarven building stand."



"*This clearing will do."



"*More wargs are coming out of the hills! "



"*Let's get that fortress up!"



"*We must remove the Dwarves before we can make it through the pass."



"*The Easterlings are with us now. We can build their Palace to hire more of them."



"*Be on the look out for dragons, they can attack at any time."



"*Dragons roam freely in this area. Be careful."



"*Dragons roam freely in this area. Watch out for their fire."



"*Hah. The dwarves struggle against the mighty beasts! The dragons will be worthy allies indeed."



"*The Dragon! It's attacking us!"



"*Kill everything! Dwarves and dragons alike. We cannot let them get in our way."



"*Avoid the Dragons. We must not anger them."



"*Watch out for the wagons! They'll run us over!"



"*This treasure must belong to a dragon. We should let it be."



"*Take the treasure. Let's see what happens."



"*Ah! We've upset a dragon!"



"*Watch out, a fire drake!"

"*Tear down their walls!"



"*Scrape them out of this valley."



"*We need more Orcs."



"*They must be tired of living. They are coming to US now. Heh!"



"*Surely the Dragon Lord will approve our removal of the Dwarves."



"*A Dragon. Take cover!"



"*Watch the skies! Dragons are everywhere!"



"*The Dragon Lord at last! We have come to offer you Dwarven riches…"



"*The people of Dale flee before us. They are wise to trust their senses."



"*And where are the dwarves? They hide in their holes under the mountain like frightened rats. "



"*Clear out the city of Dale. Seize any resources you might find."



"*They have ranged defenses. Bring out the catapults!"



"*Break that door down!"



"*We need more room to build our Fortress! Bring up the siege weapons!"



"*We'll need to build at least one catapult."

"*We'll need to build at least 3 catapults."



"*We'll need to build at least 4 catapults."



"*We'll need to build at least 5 catapults."



"*Their hero Dwalin is defiant! Slay him and relieve him of his worries."



"*Slay that pest Dwalin, like we did his brother in Moria."



"*That dwarf hero gives these dwarves strength. Slay him."



"*The men have a hero they call King Brand. Show him to his grave."



"*Bring me the head of Dwalin."



"*Bring me the head of King Brand."

"*Fetch me the head of King Dáin"



"*Bring me the head of the proud fool Dáin."



"*I will kill this dwarf myself!"



"*This army is not worthy of Mordor! Get those orc pits churning!"



"*We can summon the Wyrm now!"



"*We can now summon a Dragon!"



"*We can now summon forth a Dragon Strike!"



"*For the king under the Mountain! For King Dáin!!"



"*Dwarves of the Mountain! Remember this day! For we will at last defeat the wretched fiends of Mordor!"

"*Set up camp in the ravine!"



"*Soon our allies will arrive from the East. We won't wait for them. Let the fun begin!"



"*The Gate is too well defended. We must find another way in."



"*I will help you protect Rivendell, father!"



"*Wash away this evil!"



"*Rise up, River Bruinen! Cleanse the valley of this evil!"



"*Rivendell is our last hope! It must not fall!"



"*NOOOooo! Arwen!"

"*A third trumpet, and the skies darken, this surely is our final battle!"



"*Unlikely words from you, Master Dwarf! But we will not perish at the hands of this rabble, I swear to you!"



"*We must rally our strength and stand firm against this final attack!"



"*We are victorious! Grace and good fortune both have favored us on this day of battle!"



"*We have failed - Mithlond has fallen to the enemy!"



"*There are Shipwrights to the North and South. We should destroy them!"



"*Mordor must have a Fortress. We should destroy it."

"*King Dáin! We shall fight along side you!"



"*All the Catapults are destroyed."



"*Those fire ships! They are relentless!"

"*You can build up the heavy equipment in here."



"*Our Forgeworks are located here."



"*We will need to send troops to Dale."



"*We must set up a defense out here to buy some time for our defenses inside the mountain."



"*Hold the city of Dale while we build up our defenses inside the mountain."



"*They're attacking the Gate!"



"*The gate is heavily damaged!"



"*They've almost broken through!"



"*The Mordor scum defile our Throne!"



"*If the Throne is destroyed all hope is lost!"



"*Hurry, we must build up the defenses of Dale, the Enemy draws near!"



"*The Mordor host draws near. I can smell their foul stench."



"*Ha! Is that the best they can do!?"



"*We can use the buildings inside Erebor to train up more troops."



"*Dale might be lost, but we still have more resources in the mountain."



"*The Mordor army approaches... CLOSE THE GATE!"



"*Use the undermine tunnels to retreat back into the Mountain."



"*Though Dale has fallen, all is not lost! We must defend the Mountain!"



"*Fall back inside the mountain and regroup!"



"*We can revive our fallen heroes at the Throne of Erebor."



"*Elves, we must capture the signal fires in the North and South. Once taken, our reinforcements will be summoned in turn!"



"*Our reinforcements await the Signal Fire! Capture it!"



"*Take the second Signal Fire! Our forces await our sign!"



"*The enemy hath been defeated. We have reclaimed the forests!"



"*Now, lay siege to the dark fortress and breach the inner perimeter!"



"*We must break through the inner walls of Dol Guldur. To arms!"



"*The outer walls hath been breached!"



"*Destroy every accursed building and abode within!"



"*Nothing must be left standing - destroy every foul pit and den of this wicked place!"

"*Rend the castle to ruins! It is an abomination that must not stand!"



"*The castle hath fallen!"



"*Many tortured souls perished cruelly in this prison - destroy it so that they can be at peace!"



"*We cannot leave this fell prison intact - cast it down!"



"*The prison is no more!"



"*There are still buildings left inside the fortress. We must destroy them!"



"*All buildings within the citadel are in ruins! Dol Guldur is but a hollow shell to topple!"



"*All structures have been eradicated - the dark heart of Dol Guldur has been carved out!"



"*Our hearts must not falter - vanquish the hordes of Mordor!"



"*The hosts of Mordor assail us from the forest! Slay every last one of them!"



"*We have survived! The Mordor army is no more!"



"*The Shadow has overwhelmed us - retreat!"



"*First, a builder needs to construct us a cave!"



"*We need a goblin cave to create our invasion force - Get moving builder!"



"*Our tunnels will provide resources. With more of them, our riches will grow…."



"*Build us a second tunnel so that we may conquer this land…"



"*We need a second tunnel, you lazy workers!"



"*Once built, our tunnels will connect with each other."



"*Yesss, use the tunnels to move our forces through Lorien quickly"



"*First, move our forces into the tunnel, then choose another tunnel from which they will emerge…"



"*Ahhhh, yes! The Goblin Cave is complete!"



"*Build our hordes of Goblins for the attack on Lorien."



"*We need more goblins - use the Cave!"



"*How can we conquer the city with this rabble! Bring us more goblins!"



"*The Goblins are ready!"



"*We must summon dark powers to turn the odds of battle in our favor. Choose a power to use against our enemy."



"*Once a power has fully charged, select it, and cast it upon a target."



"*For every accursed elf and abode we slay, our power will increase. Remember this well and choose new powers when the moment arises!"



"*Cave Trolls are mighty beasts that can swiftly demolish structures - we will need their strength to eradicate the Elven city."



"*Build us a Fissure - we can summon the Cave Trolls from there."



"*Did you hear me builders?! We need to construct a fissure!"



"*Well done! The Fissure has been completed!"



"*Before we can summon the Cave Trolls, we must upgrade the Fissure."



"*Select the Fissure, then upgrade it!"



"*Upgrade the Fissure!"



"*Excellent the fissure has been upgraded!"

"*The Cave Trolls are ready!"



"*We goblins know well the ways of taming the giant spiders. Build a Spider Lair and they will bear us forth to victory!"



"*Where is our Lair? We need the Spider Riders to trample the Elves and their city…."



"*Good, now that the Spider Lair is complete, create several groups of Spider Riders."



"*We need the Spider Riders!"



"*The Spider Riders are ready!"



"*We must defend our fortress if our conquest is to succeed! Select the build plots surrounding our fortress and construct several defensive upgrades!"



"*Choose the upgrades for our fortress from the build plots and construct them!"



"*We cannot leave our fortress defenseless! Choose an upgrade from build plots surrounding the fortress base!"



"*The defenses are complete!"



"*Move our forces across the river!"



"*Excellent. Cross the river and the end of Lorien will begin…"

"*Excellent…"



"*You have done well, my servant."



"*Well done!"



"*Remember, you can view the objectives should your memory fail you."



"*All of our builders have been slain! Create new builders at the fortress."

"*You heard him, move in and free the Giant!"



"*There must be more Giants still held captive….keep searching!"



"*Don't let the trolls near the archers - they will be slain quickly."



"*Don't squander the Giant's strength on that rabble - save it for destroying the buildings!"



"*Build another tunnel on the far side of the river, with it, we can move our troops into Lorien quickly!"



"*Our archers are useless against their buildings - bring in the Trolls!"



"*The coward Haldir flees into his forests! Hunt him down!"



"*The elf known as Haldir is their leader - find him and end his wretched existence!"



"*Have we completed all of the objectives?"

"*Thou shalt feel my wrath, foul Minions of Sauron!"



"*The Elven stronghold still stands - level it to the earth and be done with it!"



"*There! The stronghold of Lorien, Caras Galadhon! Raze it to the ground!"



"*So….the long defeat comes to this...bitterest of ends. Galadhrim - flee!"

"*Ah! I'm hurt!"



"*<haughty laughter…..>….how tragic!"



"*The Elves have tricked and cursed our forces in these parts. Today, that will end."



"*We have completed all of the objectives!"



"*Now that we've got the docks, we can build a larger navy."



"*Build some battleships from the docks, we can use them to assault the grey havens!"



"*Upgrading the ships with pirate flags will make them more powerfull."



"*Upgrade the ships with additional armour, it'll help us in the battle!"



"*Move out and capture the signal fire to the east!"



"*Select those corsairs then right click on the flag to capture the docks."



"*We can use transport ships to move troops across water."



"*Capture the signal fire already! The goblin king is waitin!"



"*The beach is ours! Now build a base and destroy the Elven city!"

"*The Dúnedain are attacking our base. Drive 'em out!"



"*So, the Dúnedain have set up camp here."

"*The Dragon Lord will be pleased we have freed these drakes, bring them too him and he may join our cause."



"*Dragons are attacking the Dwarves! Let's aid them in elimating the dwarf menace."



"*We've freed the drakes and now they fight for us!"



"*There are still more drakes being held by the dwarves. Let's go free them."



"*We've freed all the drakes. Now we must find the Dragon Lord and bring them to him."



"*These drakes are a powerfull ally. Use them to wipe out the dwarves."



"*Hurry, we must free the drakes before its too late."



"*All the drakes are freed! Bring them to the Dragon Lord."



"*We must not allow many more drakes to perish, we need to bring them to the Dragon Lord."



"*Knock down the gate and the drakes will be free!"



"*Once we break down that gate, the drakes will fight for us!"



"*Take down that gate. We must free the drakes!"



"*The gate is destroyed! Drakes, wreak havoc upon the dwarves!"



"*Bring the drakes to the Dragon Lord! Sauron cannot wait!"



"*Kick down the gate! Free the drakes!"



"*A dwarf counter attack! Destroy them all!"



"*Combine the fire of the catapults and set the land ablaze."



"*Destroy the town buildings to make room for our encampment!"



"*What are you waiting for?!? Destroy those homes!"



"*The homes of the town must be demolished."



"*Set the city of Dale ablaze!"



"*Raze the buildings of Dale with these catapults."



"*Use the siege party to lay waste to the town's buildings."



"*A party of Dwarves approach form the Southwest, be wary!"



"*It's the fool Glóin! He's rallied the dwarves of the Iron Hills!"



"*Glóin has rallied the Blue Mountain dwarves…the genocide will be complete!"



"*Bring the Dragons down upon their bald stunty heads!"



"*Oh look, the last of the Dúnedain have joined the fight. Kill them."



"*Gandalf has brought his party of fools. Destroy them."



"*Mordor has sent us some catapults to help break into Rivendell!"



"*The Witch-king has brought some Nazgûl to deal with the Eagles."



"*The fury of Mount Doom has risen. The Rain of Fire Power is within reach."



"*The 'King' of Gondor must be punished for his insolence! Bring us the head of Arwen!"



"*Bring us the head of Arwen"



"*Aragorn will pay for his attacks against Sauron, murder his true love…Arwen."



"*These Heroes bring hope to the people of Middle-earth…Annihilate them."



"*The House of Elrond is well defended, destroy it and the surrounding fortresses."



"*The army of the dead! We must steel our defenses!"



"*Destroy their fortresses and the House of Elrond!"



"*Defend the HOUSE! They must not get close."



"*Welcome m’lord to the White Mountains. We’ve long awaited your arrival."



"*This pass has long been forgotten and as a result Goblins from the Misty Mountains have ventured all the way south and infested this area. If we don’t do something about them quickly they may spread all the way to Minas Tirith"



"*But first, we’ll have to get you battle worthy for the task ahead"



"*Moving around the field of battle is important in controlling your army."



"*To navigate the map, hold down the right mouse button and move your mouse around."



"*You can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard to do this."



"*Excellent! I see you’ve brought some soldiers with you. Left click on them with your cursor."



"*Now that you have them selected, move them into the camp by right clicking on the ground in the spotlight up ahead."



"*Those spotlights will help guide you through this mission, so keep an eye out for them."



"*Now for our mission here; The Goblins have been raiding our camps and need to be dealt with quickly. We need you to lead this battle."



"*Currently you know how to select one battalion of units, but you’ll need to know how to select an army."



"*In order to select multiple battalions quickly, click and hold the left mouse button down on empty space and drag your mouse. A selection box will appear and any units that are in this box will be selected for you."



"*Select the battalions in the spotlights by using the selection box method."



"*Good job! Now, move those units up to the spotlight ahead by right clicking on the ground with them selected."



"*The Goblins are attacking! We need to send reinforcements!"



"*Select your army again using the selection box method."



"*Now issue them an attack command by right clicking on those Goblins down there. You’ll notice that as you move your cursor over the Goblins, it changes to a Red Attack Cursor. This Red Attack cursor will indicate what is an enemy to you."



"*Hurry, they’ve almost destroyed the camp down there! Issue your attack order by selecting your units and right clicking on those enemy Goblins!"



"*Congratulations, you’ve just won your first battle. Unfortunately, our celebration will have to wait. More reports are coming in that other camps are being attacked and need support."



"*A quick way to find out where you need to go is by looking at the Palantir. The Palantir is located at the bottom left of your screen. Within it you'll find the mini-map."



"*The mini-map is an overhead view of the entire map. Currently the camp locations on the mini map are being flashed."



"*White flashes inform you of objective locations. While a red flash would indicate where your forces are being attacked."



"*On the Palantir you'll find the Objectives Menu. If you forget what your current objective is, click on that button and it will be displayed."



"*Click on the Objective button now to see what your current objective is."



"*There are two types of objectives, Main Objectives and Bonus Objectives. Main Objectives appear in white text and need to be accomblished in order to complete a mission."



"*Bonus Objectives appear in green text. You may choose to complete them, but they won’t count against you if you don’t."



"*And finally, any Objective with a check mark in its box is one that you’ve completed."



"*To exit the Objectives Screen, click on the Resume Game button at the bottom."



"*Now, move your army to those camps and help eliminate the Goblin threats."



"*Thank you, sir! We should be fine from now on. Hurry though, the other outpost is still under attack."



"*A giant! Slay the beast before it makes it to the outpost!"



"*You came just in time. We weren’t sure how much longer we could have held them off."



"*Well done! All the camps are now secure and the road between them is safe."



"*While our camps up here are sufficient to hold this road, it’s not strong enough to hold this mountain. We need to setup a larger camp, but we’ll need a great deal of land with which to do so."



"*Up ahead is just such an expanse of land, but it is held by Spider Lairs. These lairs are infested with creatures that have no allegiance to anyone save their own. Fortunately the creatures won’t stray far from their lairs, so they only pose a threat in their immediate area."



"*Clear those lairs out and we should be able to establish our new camp here."



"*When a lair is destroyed, it will leave behind rubble. You will also need to destroy the rubble or else the lair will rebuild itself and the creatures will come forth from it again."



"*After you destroy a lair, it will leave some money behind. That’s the treasure that they’ve hoarded from killing wanderers who’ve ventured too close to them."



"*Excellent! An abandoned Outpost. We can capture this building for our own."



"*To capture this outpost, select a battalion, and right click on the flag next to the outpost."



"*While the building is being captured, it's current flag will lower, and our flag will raise in its place."



"*The outpost is ours! It will now provide further resources for our army."



"*Now to get started on our camp."



"*We sent a builder your way for constructing our new camp. Builders are what you use to construct all the buildings we’ll need in order to establish a camp."



"*First and foremost we’ll need a Fortress."



"*To build a fortress, while having your Builder selected, left click on the Fortress button which is flashing now."



"*In order to place down a building, left click anywhere on the land. For this base however, we’ll need you to place your fortress within the spotlighted area."



"*While our fortress is building, let me tell you a bit about it. Fortresses can produce more Builders, as well as Heroes such as our Lord Boromir."



"*They also have many upgrades available to them, but we’ll get to that another time."



"*Now that we have a fortress built, we’ll need an economy to fund our defenses."



"*Select the builder and build a Farm on the spotlight in the upper left. As you place the farm down, notice that it has a percentage attached to it. This percentage will tell you how productive it will be, given its current location on land."



"*Things such as mountains, water, or other obstacles will reduce the productivity of a Farm. The resources farms produce can be tracked by the number at the bottom left of the Palantir."



"*Farms contribute to your army's Command Point Limit. So the more farms you build, the more battalions you can command."



"*Your Command Point Limit can be tracked by the number at the bottom right of the Palantir."



"*We now need to build up some structures to train more units for our army."



"*Select the builder again and build a Barracks on the next spotlight."



"*The Barracks will be able to produce Soldiers as well as Tower Guards."



"*The last thing we’ll need is an Archery Range. Build one of those on the other spotlight."



"*From here we can train Archers and Rangers."



"*As well as having structures, our base will need fortifications."



"*In order to fortify our base, we’ll need to setup wall spans. Wall spans begin with wall hubs, which can be built from either our fortress or from our Builders."



"*In order to build them from the fortress, click on the build plot highlighted."



"*Notice the different options of things you can build. One of them is the Wall Hub. Click on that button to begin building it now."



"*Click on the wall hub button to begin building it."



"*Now that the Wall Hub is completed, you can select it. This will bring up a wall expanse button."



"*Click that button and move your cursor to the Spotlight to the right. As you move your mouse you’ll see a see-through wall; this is how your wall will look when you’ve finished building it."



"*To build it, left click on the ground where the Spotlight is."



"*Now, click on the wall hub you just built in the Spotlight and build another wall expanse off to the south along the ridge. Another Spotlight is setup showing you where your wall should end."



"*Excellent, now repeat what you just did on the northern side of our fortress. Select the build plot highlighted and build a wall span to the Spotlight to the right. Then build to the next spotlight in the north."



"*Excellent job! Our camp is better defended but still not impenetrable. We will need to build wall DEFENSES."



"*You may upgrade a wall with offensive structures such as Arrow Towers and Trebuchets. Or you can build Postern Gates and Large Gates with which to move your armies through. You may also turn it into another wall HUB."



"*A good wall defense is the Trebuchet. Select any wall segment and build a Trebuchet upgrade on it."



"*Our base has begun. Now let’s build some units to defend it. Train 2 battalions of Gondor Soldiers from the Barracks now."



"*Great! Now train two battalions of Gondor Archers from the Archery Range."



"*And lastly, we’ll need a Hero to lead our troops. Heroes can be purchased from the Fortress. And if your Hero should fall in battle, they can be revived from the fortress as well."



"*To summon a Hero, select your fortress and click on the Heroes button. This will bring up options of all the current Heroes you’re allowed to build. Right now Boromir is residing in our fortress."



"*Click on his portrait to summon him."



"*Welcome Lord Boromir! Heroes in general have an array of special powers and abilities that make them unique and vital for a strong army. Select Boromir now."



"*You will find a Hero’s abilities on the Palantir. Some are Passive abilities which mean they’re always enabled such as Boromir’s Leadership ability."



"*Others powers can be set to \"" by right clicking its button in the palantir. You will see its outline sparkle when this is enabled."



"*Right click on Boromir's Horn of Gondor ability to set it to autocast."



"*Our army is built now and Gondor’s new castle is ready. Excellent work! You're now ready to command an army and defend these passes."



"*The Goblins, they’re here! A large force has gathered and is marching towards this very spot."



"*There is no time to waste. M’lord, you will have to defend this base as you’ve done before with the camps."



"*Remember, select your army and right click on the enemy units to issue attack orders. You can select one battalion at a time and issue them attack orders to specific enemy battalions."



"*The Eagles have come! By the glory of Gondor, we shall send these goblins back to their netherworld!"



"*Victory is ours! Great job my lord! That ought to send those Goblins back to their caves."



"*Come back when you’re ready to finish them off by playing through the Advanced Tutorial."



"*Welcome back M’lord! As you can see we’ve been very busy here, but the attacks have yet to stop."



"*The Goblins seem to be coming from across the river. I suggest we take the fight to their base!"



"*Before we move forward however, I would like to teach you some of the tactics that our battalions have been working on."



"*Each Battalion can enter a particular attack mode, or what we refer to as Stances. These stances can boost their power or defense. Click on the Gondor Soldier Battalion in the Spotlight."



"*The Stances button is located on the Palantir. If you click on it, it will bring up a menu with 3 stances to choose from."



"*The Aggressive Stance will increase a unit’s offensive capabilities while decreasing their defensive capabilities."



"*The Battle Stance is the default stance for all units and renders no bonuses or negatives to a unit’s abilities."



"*And the Hold Ground Stance will greatly increase a unit’s defensive capabilities while decreasing their offensive capabilities."



"*Set the battalion you have selected into its Aggressive Stance by clicking on the Aggressive Stance button."



"*Excellent! Now let's have our army form up into a battle line."



"*Now press and hold both the right and left mouse buttons and drag your mouse. You’ll notice that a Formation Preview will display on the ground. Once you release the mouse buttons, your units will form up into this battle line."



"*Now back to the matter at hand. We must take our army across the river and over to the enemy's base. In order to do so we will need a Shipwright."



"*There's a shipwright to the East of here along the river."



"*Move a battalion to the shipwright and capture it. Remember, to capture it, right click on the flag next to it while having a battalion selected."



"*The shipwright is ours! Selecting it will bring up options of different types of vessels you may purchase."



"*The Transport will ferry your troops across large bodies of water."



"*Battleships will help destroy enemy ships that impede your way."



"*It appears as though Gondor has sent reinforcements to aid us in our reclaiming of this mountain. Let’s join up with them by building a transport of our own. Select the shipwright and click on the Transport button to begin building one."



"*Now select your battalion and right click on the Transport. You’ll notice that your cursor changes to a garrison icon. Other structures in Middle-earth can be garrisoned as well, so keep an eye out for that icon."



"*Great, now move your transport into the spotlight to join up with the rest of the convoy."



"*A Nazgûl! Watch out!"



"*It took out one of the transports! Hurry, get to the beach quickly!"



"*Take down those Corsair ships! Send them to bottom of the river!"



"*You’ve made it across, M’Lord. Well done. In order to deploy your units from a transport, select the transport ship and give it a move order on land."



"*There’s one of their camps up ahead. We’ll have to rush them before they have a chance to retreat and warn any others. Issue an \"" order and that should take care of them."



"*To issue an \"" order, select your army and press the A key on your keyboard. This will change your cursor to an Attack Move cursor."



"*Then, right click on the ground in the spotlight behind the camp. This will send your army on a path of destruction to that point, killing every enemy they encounter."



"*It appears as though some of the Goblins have retreated over that wall. Unfortunately Goblins are able to scale walls by climbing them whereas we are not. Nor do we have any siege weapons to take down those walls quickly."



"*We’ll have to call in for greater powers to help us progress any farther."



"*At your disposal is a list of powers that can be purchased from the Evenstar icon located on the Palantir. Click on the Evenstar icon now."



"*As you can see, all the powers are tiered, which means you have to purchase the lower costing powers in order to access the more expensive ones."



"*In order to purchase a power, you must have power points equal to or greater than the number associated with that power."



"*Go ahead and purchase the Arrow Volley and Earthquake power. They are currently the only ones available to buy."



"*To exit, click on the Accept button at the bottom of the screen."



"*Every time you buy a new power, it will appear on the left hand side of your screen just above the Palantir."



"*Now back to the battle. First let’s take down those Goblins taunting us from the other side of the wall. Left click on the Arrow Volley power and move your cursor over the goblins."



"*To cast the power, left click on the ground."



"*That got 'em good! Keep in mind that certain powers such as Arrow Volley can only be cast in areas that are visible to you."



"*Now to get past this wall. Unfortunately the gate is in disrepair and cannot be opened, so we’ll have to destroy these walls."



"*The Earthquake power will deal a significant amount of damage to these walls and should be enough to clear our path."



"*Left click on the Earthquake power now and left click underneath those walls to cast it."



"*Left click on the Earthquake power now and right click underneath those walls to cast it."



"*Excellent! The Goblin’s main base is not much farther off. Continue north along the path and be wary of any more camps you encounter."



"*M’Lord, we are glad you have come. We’ve been keeping an eye on this Goblin camp and have setup a trap for them. All we need to do is set the forest ablaze around them and it should spread into their camp."



"*Fire, M’Lord, has become a valuable asset as of late. Unfortunately in our enemies hands it could also be a serious danger."



"*Select the Rangers who have joined you and have them volley their arrows into the spotlights. This will start a fire there and you’ll be able to watch it spread into the enemy's base, setting it ablaze and destroying their structures."



"*That was the last of their camps, their main base is just to the west. We should move quickly lest they assemble and come to meet us unprepared."



"*The final battle at last. They seem unaware of our presence. This should prove extremely useful."



"*To truly have this battle work to our advantage, we should use Planning Mode. To enter this mode, click on the Planning Mode button located on the Palantir."



"*In Planning Mode, you can issue orders for every one of your units, and then have them execute those orders simultaneously."



"*If at any time you make a mistake and want to change the order for a particular unit, select the unit and press the Delete Action button. This will remove the last order you gave them, and continue until they have no orders at all."



"*Now lets devise a plan to crush every last one of those nasty Goblins! First, I recommend \"" with your cavalry at those Goblin Warriors in the northern most part of the base. Do so by selecting your cavalry, pressing A on your keyboard, and left clicking on the ground in the middle of those Goblins."



"*You may also notice that those Goblins have their backs turned to you. This will result in the cavalry flanking those units. Any time a unit is flanked, it will receive more damage from it’s attackers."



"*Next, I would recommend taking the Rangers that joined you and have them cast their volley on the hill to the south of the base. The fire that you start there should spread to the Giant and burn him to the ground!"



"*Last, I’d send the remaining forces you have into the heart of their base and kill every last one of them. Try splitting your forces amongst the different targets in their base."



"*When you’re plan has been laid out, hit the execute button and your army will march forth with their orders."



"*We’re winning M’Lord, but their fortress is killing our army. Use your earthquake power again on their Fortress and it should take down their defenses!"



"*Victory is ours! The Goblin threat has been eliminated once and for all in this mountain pass. Minas Tirith will be pleased to hear of our victory and may sleep safely knowing this pass is once again controlled by Gondor."



"*And you, M’Lord are now ready to vanquish more evil from Middle-earth. Take with you all that you have learned and try a campaign, a skirmish versus the AI, or a multiplayer match online against your friends!"



"*Welcome to the War Of The Ring tutorial."



"*Here you will learn the basics of how to build an empire to rule them all."



"*The War Of The Ring is a turn-based strategic game of territory conquest, resource management, and epic confrontations that takes place over the lands of Middle-earth."



"*The game is played on the living world map."



"*Territories that are under your control will be highlighted with your color and territories claimed by your enemies will be highlighted with their respective colors."



"*To zoom in and out of the map, push the mouse wheel forward and backward."



"*To scroll through the map, push your cursor towards the edge of the screen to move in that direction."



"*Try moving around the map now."



"*That's it! Very good!"



"*The game is played as a series of turns that are taken simultaneously by all players."



"*A single turn is divided into 3 phases: Tactical, Battle, and Retreat."



"*The current phase of a turn is always displayed in the phase indicator at the top of the screen. Below the phase indicator is an expandable window that displays critical tasks and provides gameplay hints for the current phase."



"*Each phase must be completed by all players before the game continues to the next phase. When all phases have been completed, the turn is over and a new turn begins."



"*Turn 1"



"*Tactical Phase"



"*In the tactical phase, you will make all your strategic choices regarding the expansion of your kingdom."



"*Structure Construction, Unit Training, and Army Movement are all decided in this phase."



"*First, you will focus on structure construction in the tactical phase of this turn."



"*Structure Construction"



"*You can construct new buildings on any open build plot in a territory you control."



"*There are four basic structure classes to choose from, Fortress, Barracks, Armoury, and Farm. Each structure class provides a necessary function to a growing empire."



"*Build fortresses to strengthen the defenses in your territories. Build barracks to train new units for your armies. Build armouries to improve your armies attack and defensive capabilities. And build farms to support the population growth of your empire."



"*To build a new structure, left click on a build plot to bring up the menu that shows all the available buildings that can be constructed. Then left click on the building you want to construct."



"*Select the open build plot in Cair Andros and build a barracks."



"*Good job!"



"*All structures cost a number of turns to build and only one structure per territory can be under construction at a time."



"*Once all players have completed the tactical phase, the strategic choices of each player are revealed on the living world map, and the game continues to the next phase."



"*Since you are not going to construct any more buildings at this time, press the End Phase button to finish the tactical phase."



"*Battle Phase"



"*In the Battle Phase, all conflicts between opposing players are fought."



"*A battle occurs when at least one of your armies and one of your enemy's armies end up in the same territory after the planned moves are executed from the tactical phase."



"*Since there are not any conflicts at this time, the game will continue to the next phase."



"*Retreat Phase"



"*In the Retreat phase, all armies lead by Heroes that are defeated in battle must withdraw to safe territories."



"*Since you do not have any defeated Hero armies at this time, the game will continue to the next phase."



"*Now that all phases have been finished, a single turn in War Of The Ring is completed. A new turn begins and you start again at the tactical phase."



"*Turn 2"



"*Tactical Phase"



"*The barracks you started to build in the previous turn has been completed and its abilities are now available for you to use."



"*Next, you will concentrate on unit training in the tactical phase of this turn."



"*Unit Training"



"*Command points represent the number of troops you are allowed to train. You can not build more troops than you have command points."



"*Your world command point limit indicates the current population of your empire that inhabits the whole of Middle-earth. It is displayed at the top left corner of the screen."



"*The number of units that can reside in each army and territory are also bound by their own command point limits."



"*You can train new units at any one of your barracks."



"*There are four basic unit classes to choose from, Soldier, Archer, Pikeman, and Cavalry. Each unit class has their own distinct traits and capabilities when fighting the other unit classes."



"*To train a new battalion, left click on a barracks to bring up the menu that shows all the available units that can be trained. Then left click on the unit you want to train."



"*Select the barracks in Cair Andros and train a battalion of troops."



"*Well done!"



"*All battalions cost a number of turns to train and only one set of troops per barracks can be in training at a time."



"*Since you are not going to train any more units at this time, press the End Phase button to finish the tactical phase."



"*Again, no conflicts have occurred, so the game will pass through the battle and retreat phases."



"*The turn is finished and now another turn begins."



"*Turn 3"



"*Tactical Phase"



"*The battalion you started to train in the previous turn has been completed and is now available for you to command into battle."



"*Finally, you will learn army movement in the tactical phase of this turn."



"*Army Movement"



"*All armies are allowed to move to only 1 adjacent territory from their current location per turn. However, the choice of an army's destination depends on the type of army that is being moved."



"*There are 2 types of armies under your command, Garrison Armies, and Hero Armies."



"*A garrison army is composed of all the troop battalions that reside in a territory."



"*To examine the composition of an army, left click to select an army. Then left click on the Selection Details button on the Palantir at the lower left of the screen. This will reveal a panel that shows the individual battalions and units that make up the selected army."



"*Select the garrison army in Cair Andros and examine its composition by displaying the details panel."



"*Observe that the battalion you just trained appears here."



"*From this panel, detailed stats for each battalion in an army can be seen, and commands to the individual battalions themselves can be given."



"*Garrison armies are used to defend the lands of your empire and can only move between territories that you control. Thus, they cannot take over neutral territories or invade enemy territories on their own. However, a garrison army can join with a Hero army to strengthen a Hero army's attacking forces."



"*To order a garrison army to join a Hero army, left click to select a garrison army. Then right click on the desired Hero army to have the battalions of your selected army merge with the Hero forces."



"*Notice that your cursor changes to a join icon when you have a garrison army selected and move your mouse over a Hero army that it can legally join."



"*Order the garrison army in Cair Andros to join Aragorn's army in Rohan."



"*Excellent!"



"*A Hero army is a group of battalions that are commanded by a special Hero that has the ability to lead troops into battle. They can not only move between territories that you control, but are also used to expand the lands of your kingdom by conquering neutral territories and invading enemy territories."



"*Acquiring territories collects bonuses for your empire."



"*To order a Hero army to move into a territory, left click to select a Hero army. Then right click on the desired territory to send your selected Hero army to that location."



"*Notice that your cursor changes to a movement icon when you have an army selected and move your mouse over a territory that it can legally travel into."



"*Select Aragorn's army in Rohan and move into The Dead Marshes."



"*Very good!"



"*Since you are not going to move any more armies at this time, press the End Phase button to finish the tactical phase."



"*Battle Phase"



"*This time during the battle phase there are encounters with the enemy that must be resolved."



"*Active battles are indicated by an animated battle marker."



"*To settle the encounter, left click the battle marker."



"*Select the battle marker in Osgiliath to resolve the conflict."



"*This battle screen shows you detailed information about your forces and the enemy forces involved in the skirmish in the contested territory."



"*You may have up to 3 methods for handling an encounter: Auto-Resolve, Realtime, or Retreat."



"*Selecting Auto-Resolve will calculate the winner of the battle automatically based on factors such as the size, unit composition, and experience of the forces involved."



"*Selecting Realtime will allow you to manually fight the battle in the disputed territory."



"*Selecting Retreat will allow you to withdraw your forces from the conflict before the battle starts. However, your retreating armies may lose some units in the process."



"*When the battle has been resolved, ownership of the territory will be awarded to the winner."



"*For the purposes of the tutorial, all battles will be auto-resolved."



"*Press the Auto-Resolve button to fight the battle in Osgiliath."



"*You lost this battle, but not the war. Don't give up."



"*During the Battle phase there may be multiple conflicts. Each conflict is resolved one at a time."



"*Select the battle marker in The Dead Marshes to resolve the conflict."



"*You have defeated the enemy! Well done!"



"*Once all battles have been resolved, the battle phase is over."



"*Press the End Phase button to finish the battle phase."



"*Retreat Phase"



"*Since one of your Hero armies has been defeated in battle, you must withdraw that army to a friendly territory to recover. Only the Hero army leaders survive from a lost battle and have the ability to retreat."



"*To order a Hero army to retreat, left click to select a defeated Hero army. Then right click on a friendly territory to send your army to that location."



"*Select Boromir's army in Osgiliath and retreat to one of your territories."



"*Good job!"



"*Once all retreat orders have been issued, the retreat phase is over."



"*Press the End Phase button to finish the retreat phase."



"*The turn is over, but the battle for Middle-earth has just begun."



"*This concludes the War Of The Ring tutorial. Follow these simple guidelines and you will soon dominate the whole of Middle-earth."

"The remaining Dúnedain of this region have rallied the help of the Blue Mountain Dwarves. It is in the old fortress of Fornost where they will see their last moments. Once our work here is done, all of the lands West of the Misty Mountains will be ours!"

"The Dwarves are capturing the Dragons when they are still young. These Drakes can be very powerful. Free any Drakes that they might have captured, and they will join us against the Dwarves!"



"Our supply lines are thin. Pillage Dale for any resources you can find. Then lay siege to the Dwarven mountain fortress of Erebor. Shelob and the spiders of Mirkwood have been sent as scouts due to their speed and their appetite for destruction."

"*The enemy has landed on our western shores. Fend them off!"



"*Build transport ships to move our battalions across the waters."



"*The Shipwrights have crafted us an enchanted vessel - the Storm Ship. When it rams into enemies, it creates a swirling vortex that will sink ally and foe alike."



"*The lore of our Shipwrights is unparalleled, but remember to upgrade our naval vessels!"



"*By the Hammer of Glóin, we're cut off."



"*This battle has gone ill - our forces scattered, the settlement overrun. We need the luck of the gods or all will be lost."



"*We're outnumbered ten to one. We must find our scattered warriors and lead 'em to the docks. Only then can we stand a chance against all those bleedin' orcs."



"*We must get back to the docks and the rest of our forces, or we're as good as dead."

"*They're summoning a Rain of fire!"



"*They've awoken a Wyrm in Dale!"



"*There's a Wyrm destroying the city!"



"*Surely, we'll need an army bigger then this surely! They're bringing TROLLS!"



"*Build more defensive structures. They're our only hope of stopping them."



"*<gasp> That’s a lot of trolls!"



"*By my mother's beard, have you ever seen so many trolls?"



"*There's too many of them! FALL BACK!"



"*Look out! The Mouth of Sauron has found a secret entry!"



"*He's inside the mountain!"



"*There are Black Riders inside the Mountain!"



"*The Mouth of Sauron has found a way inside the Mountain!"



"*A Corsair looting party has been spotted to the south."



"*The Haradrim have come to pillage Dale!"



"*By King Dáin's beard, the haradrim have brought their Mûmakil!"

"*Cut the chatter, there's enemies to axe!"



"*Look at the size of that thing!"

"*They're attacking our right flank!"



"*A small group of fighters have split off from the main group."



"*More Corsair Looters!"



"*The Mordor host is approaching. The first wave will arrive soon. We must build up our defenses in Dale to keep them away from the Mountain."



"*If the forces of Mordor breach the defenses in Dale, we must fall back to the Great Fortress in the mountain."



"*We've spotted a small enemy force. They're trying to break into Erebor through a side tunnel."



"*They're trying to break in through the side!"



"*They're attacking the side gates!"



"*Look there! The trolls! They're trying to get in through the side!"



"*These forests are infested with Spiders - destroy all their lairs!"



"*The dark powers of the Enemy are bolstered by these Signal Fires. Seize all of them!"



"*We have word from our Scouts. A great host of Mordor returns to defend the fortress!"



"*A forest fire has been ignited! Workers, extinguish the flames, lest our fortress be burned to ashes!"



"*The Eye of the Dark Lord wanders wide... even in Mordor our designs cannot escape his thought! Ready our defenses, for the Enemy draws near!"



"*Ready our defenses! Reinforcements from Mordor will be arriving soon!"



"*So! Is this Celeborn and his elf-witch leading their people in their dramatic finale? How endearing! Kill them!"



"*Ahhhh! The Elf-witch Galadriel and her foolish mate grace us with their presence - such exquisite pleasure their deaths shall bring!"



"*Move our forces across the river and cast down their beloved homes and trees!"



"*The Elves have been leaving Middle-earth by means of this port city they call the Grey Havens. Our presence in their harbor will be wholly unexpected. And once we destroy any sign of elves here, we will use this port to reinforce our invasion force into Eriador."



"*Tis the fabled Green Dragon Inn. Burn it to the ground!"



"*The Green Dragon Inn is nothing but wreckage. Haha!"



"*We come from Dunland to assist you, Goblin King."



"*The Hobbits of The Shire have caused our Dark Lord much trouble. Our domination of Eriador would not be complete without crushing this pocket of resistance."



"*The domination over Eriador would not be complete without us crushing The Shire. These Hobbit pests have caused much trouble for our Dark Lord Sauron."



"*Now listen up...the Hobbits' have four governing Seats of Power. Destroy these buildings, and we quell whatever hope they might have for reprisal."



"*Let's get to it!"



"*The remaining Dúnedain of this region have rallied the help of the Blue Mountain Dwarves. It is in this abandoned fortress of Fornost where they will see their last moments. Once our work is done, all of the lands West of the Misty Mountains will be ours!"



"*The northern parts of Mirkwood are the home of the Wood-elves. The first step in expelling them from their forest home is to seize the Old Forest Road. Once we control this road, we can dominate the rest of Mirkwood with ease."



"*We must assemble an army and advance to the Old Forest Road."



"*We can cross over to the north at the bridge along the river."



"*Our scouts have found a way down into the river to the east."



"*We need fire to burn those Ents to the ground!"



"*We can purchase Fire Arrows from the Tavern."



"*We've found the Ent base! Burn every last Ent and Ent Moot to the ground!"



"*Find the Elven bases and destroy them to halt their defense of this road!"



"*The elves have all four towers up. Take them down quick or we shall lose the road!"



"*We must earn favor with the dragons here. Destroy any Dwarf settlements you encounter."



"*The Dwarves are capturing the Dragons when they are still young. These Drakes can be very powerful. Free any Drakes that they have captured, and they will join us against the Dwarves!"



"*We've freed the drakes, now we must find the dragon lord."



"*The mountain fortress of Erebor: The great pride of the Dwarves."



"*Before assaulting the mountain we must first conquer the city of Dale and pillage it of any resources we might find."



"*Shelob and the spiders of Mirkwood have been sent as scouts. They have great speed and an... appetite for destruction."



"*This is it... The Elves last effort to withstand the onslaught of Sauron's power. The Mordor forces from the East shall be arriving soon. Crush the last haven for the Elves."



"*Frodo, the free people’s last hope, lies dead."



"*Now all what remains of these people have gathered here at the Elven city of Rivendell. As we begin the final siege, the Dark Lord makes his way west. Crush the last haven for the Elves."



"*Select a Builder by left clicking on it."



"*You'll notice that a menu appears on the right hand side of the screen. This menu will show all building options currently available."



"*A quick way to select a Builder is by clicking on the Select Nearest Builder button next to the Palantir at the bottom of your screen."



"*It seems as though you've built your structure away from the spotlight. To demolish a building, select it and click on the Demolish button in the Palantir."



"*In order to do this, select multiple battalions and move your cursor over to the spotlight."



"*To cast the power, right click on the ground."



"*There's their main base. Those tunnels must be how they've been traveling through these mountains."



"*One thing to note about their tunnels is that when destroyed, you must also destroy the rubble they leave behind. Otherwise the tunnels will spring forth once more and the Goblins will be able to use them yet again."



"*If we completely destroy their tunnels and their fortress, that should put a stop to them infesting these mountains once and for all."



"*Oh no! Goblins are pouring out from the tunnels, they must have seen us!"

"*Rivendell is a hidden refuge and stronghold for the Elves."



"*Until now, this ancient city has been spared from the winds of war."



"*Under siege from the Goblins of the Misty Mountains, Rivendell is no longer safe for the Elves."



"*As time is now running out, Elrond forms a plan to unite the Elves and Dwarves of the North against Sauron’s advancing armies."



"*His most powerful warrior, Glorfindel will join forces with the dwarf leader Glóin, to make war on the goblins and forge this alliance."



"*The Dark Lord Sauron's influence spreads far across the lands of Middle-earth."



"*Goblins descend from the Misty Mountains."



"*A vast army flows from Dol Guldur, his evil fortress in Mirkwood."



"*The War in the North begins in Lorien, where the host from Dol Guldur inteds to crush the elves wh long lived in the nearby enchated forest."



"*The elves of Lorien have been driven from their enchanted forest."



"*The tide of darkness from Dol Guldur will now spread to all of the Northern Lands."



"*The Goblins have overtaken High Pass Road, blocking the vital connection between East and West."



"*Here Glorfindel and Glóin now face their first challenge as they battle to retake the pass."



"*With the Goblin army chased from High Pass, Elves can now travel to the lands beyond the Misty Mountains."



"* The war against the Goblins continues."



"*Sauron has infuence on all things untamed."



"*The Goblins have been roused from their mountain caves and will fight for the Dark Lord."



"*Even now their armies advance on the ancient elven port city of Mithlond."



"*Sauron also sends the Corsairs of Umbar to attack from the sea."



"*Once this port is destroyed, the elves will have no hope of scaping to the West."



"*The remaining Elves have scattered into the hills."



"*Cut them in peaces!"



"*Now the Goblins have an ancient debt to pay to the Hobbits of the nearby Shire."



"*Kiiiillll!!!!"



"*Evil wells forth from an ancient fortress deep in the mountains, a foul place that has recently reawakened."



"*The Goblins have a new leader who carries out Sauron’s tyrannical will."



"*Once this sinister overlord is vanquished, the Goblins will be scattered and confused, loosening Sauron's grip on this region."



"*In the battle’s aftermath, a lone dwarven prisoner is freed and desperately begs for Glorfindel and Glóin’s help."



"*His Dwarven clan in the Blue Mountains is under attack from a terrible dragon."



"*It is rumored that the dragon serves Sauron in exchange for one of the Dwarven Rings of Power, stolen from the Dwarves long ago."



"*Long ago, a great Goblin Chief led an army into these lands known as the Shire."



"*The defending hobbits killed the chief and routed the invaders."



"*The Battle of Greenfields has not been forgotten by the Goblins and their kind."



"*Now their leader returns to the land of the Hobbits, with a determination to triumph were their ancestors failed."



"*The scourging of the Shire begins."



"*Charge!"



"*The Goblin invasion appears to be unstoppable."



"*You'll pay for this!"



"*Ya Bullies!"



"*Now Hobbits and Elves alike have been crushed and scattered throughout the lands."



"*Oh no!!!"



"*After a long journey, the heroes arrive at the Blue Mountains."



"*They find an army of Dwarves preparing for battle outside the entrance of a cave."



"*The evil dragon has forced them from their home beneath the mountains, claiming their underground domain as his new lair."



"*Sauron’s dragon has been defeated and the Dwarven ring reclaimed."



"*However, Glorfindel and Glóin are in disbelief when their new allies refuse to join in the war against Sauron, choosing instead to return to mining the riches of their mountains."



"*Disappointed, the heroes set out for the Elven port city of the Grey Havens hoping for a better reception from the Elves."



"*But as they draw near the city, it is clear that all is not well there."



"*Defend the fortress!"



"*Do not let them through!"



"*Dwarves and men are making a stand in the abandoned stronghold of Fornost."



"*Hold steady dwarves!"



"*The Goblins seek to destroy the defenders and take this ancient fortress as a prize."



"*The Goblins have cleared this region of the Sauron's enemies."



"* Rivendell is near, but its destruction must wait, for now."



"*We will infest this land!"



"*After thousands of years, Elves in Middle-earth have finally begun their exodus homeward across the sea."



"*The port city of Mithlond, known as the Grey Havens, is where they converge to set forth westward."



"*But now even this remote city isn't safe from Sauron."



"*The Corsairs of Umbar from the South have choked off their naval passage westward and threaten to overrun the ancient port."



"*The Dwarves of the Blue Mountains will fight along side the Free Peoples of Middle-earth after all."



"*As this new alliance is celebrated, Arwen Evenstar arrives with the help of the Eagles."



"*She brings the heroes troubled tidings from distant lands."



"*Sauron's massive armies from Dol Guldur have moved north into Mirkwood, the domain of the Elven King Thranduil."



"*The new allies must now rise up and prepare for the long journey eastward to aid their distant friends."



"*Arwen urges the heroes to allow the eagles to take them directly to Thranduil's side for further counsel."



"*As the Goblin hordes ravage the western lands, Sauron's forces from Dol Guldur spread North into Mirkwood."



"*The Old Forest Road divides this great woodland and is key to the domination of the region."



"*The Wood Elves of this forest, led by King Thranduil, have long protected this road."



"*They will not give it up without a fight."



"*The elves of Mirkwodd are now scattered and demoralised."



"*The remaining few now retreat West to Rivendell."



"*They're overrunning us!"



"*We cannot hold them!"



"*The time has come for Sauron to bring the war to the Dwarves."



"*They are a proud people and will not easily surrender."



"*While the heroes wing their way East, Sauron’s armies march north from Dol Guldur and arrive at a human settlement on the river Celduin."



"*Dwarves from nearby Erebor, led by King Dáin, come to the aid of their human allies to the south."



"*Before the battle ensues, Dáin sends a messenger to King Thranduil of the Wood Elves asking for their help."



"*The Dwarves must fight a desperate battle while they await reinforcements from the Elves."



"*The first wave of attackers is repelled but thousands more are approaching."



"*The Dwarven messenger returns from Mirkwood with bleak news."



"*There will be no help from the Elves as their lands are also in danger."



"*King Dáin must fall back to the city of Dale and make his stand there."



"*The Dragons of the Withered Heath are an ancient breed, and their hatred for the Dwarves burns bright even after a thousand years."



"*Sauron’s leaders turn to them, seeking a possible ally in this brewing war against the Dwarves."



"*The Mouth of Sauron enlists the Dragon Lord to help root the Dwarves out of Erebor and rid them of their king."



"*The coveted mountain fortress itself will be given as a prize."



"*The time has come for Dragons to fight for Sauron."



"*The fate of Middle-earth hangs by a thread."



"*The host from Dol Guldur marches relentlessly North towards Dale and Erebor."



"*Sauron’s armies lay siege to Minas Tirith in the South."



"*Frodo makes his way into Mordor."



"*Glorfindel and Glóin arrive at Mirkwood to meet with King Thranduil of the Wood-Elves to further the alliance between Elf and Dwarf."



"*Unaware of the council taking place in Mirkwood, King Dáin of the Dwarves grimly prepares for what may well be his final battle."



"*Dwarves! This our last chance! Defend Erebor or die!!"



"*The arrival of the Elves from Mirkwood assures a victory for the Free Peoples."



"*The siege of Erebor is broken."



"*The shadow is lifting from Middle-earth."



"*There is but one more task left: Lay bare the pits of Dol Guldur and drive the forces of darkness out of the Northern Lands."



"*At last, the final battle against the Dwarves and the Men of Dale."



"*If Sauron's forces are victorious here, then all of the lands East of the Misty Mountains will be under his rule."



"*There will be no respite for the scattered forces of the North."



"*Just as the Dwarves were long ago driven from the Mines of Moria, now they have been purged from their mountain home in Erebor."



"*…slay the Enemy to the last!"



"*The combined armies of Elf and Dwarf prepare to assault the evil fortress of Dol Guldur."



"*The final battle of the War in the North is about to begin."



"*With Sauron’s forces defeated, Galadriel at last throws down the walls of Dol Guldur."



"*Peace has returned to Middle-earth."



"*The War of the Ring is over."



"*Rivendell is the crown jewel of the North."



"*This sacred city is the last refuge for the Free Peoples of Middle-earth."



"*Sauron has but one purpose now: To claim this ancient place for his own and extinguish all hope for the Free Peoples."



"*Sauron’s reign over the Northern Lands is unopposed as the leaders of the Free People are no more."



"*Darkness now falls upon all of Middle-earth."



"*In the final years of the Third Age, Middle-earth stands on the brink of destruction."



"*The Free Peoples are under threat from Sauron, the Lord of the Rings, who prepares his vast armies for war."



"*At this late hour, the leaders of Elves, Dwarves, and Men come together at the Council of Elrond to decide their next move."



"*After the Fellowship is assembled and heads south to destroy the source of Sauron’s power, the remaining leaders prepare for the Dark Lord’s assault upon the northern lands."



"*The Elven and Dwarven races have always had little trust for each other, but now they must unite and fight a common enemy."

"In his final stand, the Witch-king sat upon his black horse before us."



"As we rode forward, he realized that all hope was lost."



"His terrifying scream of rage sent the chill of winter down our spines, as he turned and fled into the shadows."



"Earnur struck out to chase him down, But I then realized his power."



"We thought him but a powerful Black Númenórean, but he is Nazgûl, First of the Nine, most fell servant of the Dark Lord Sauron."



"I put up my hand, and called out to Earnur: 'Do not pursue him! He will not return to these lands'."



"'Far off yet is his doom, and not by the hand of man shall he fall’."



"After the Witch-king’s bloody, final triumph over Arnor, the kingdom of Gondor can look away no more,"



"lest the Iron Crown dominate all the lands of the West. Elves and Men come together to drive Evil from the north forever."



"Earnur of Gondor would lead the Men. The Elves call for Glorfindel, Elf-lord of Rivendell and Gondolin, to lead them."



"And so it is, at the will of my people, that I change  from storyteller to blade-bearer once more."



"I ride, Elrond at my side, under Earnur’s banner. Elves and Men together will drive evil from the North forever."



"We will not merely push the Witch-king back to his lair of Carn Dûm as we had foolishly done before."



"We intend the total destruction of Angmar; and this time, it will be so."



"Middle-earth enjoyed a thousand years of peace after the Ring was lost and the death of Isildur"



"…and Arthedain, the most powerful of the Northern realms,"



"still ruled by Isildur’s heirs from the capital of Fornost."



"It was during the reign of the eighth King of Arthedain that evil began to multiply in Angmar,"



"a twisted, frozen land that lay North beyond the Ettenmoors, and home of the Black Númenóreans."



"Among them a sorcerer of great power arose, known only as the Witch-king..."



"He has taken up his Iron Crown for a single purpose:"



"to destroy the Dúnedain and their kingdom of Arnor …"



"but Sauron was not dead, only cast to the shadows."



" In time, evil once more began to move…"



"Arnor: The North Kingdom of Men, ruled by the heirs of Isildur."



"This land of passion and promise is waylaid by men’s inability to set aside petty differences;"



"and so it was that civil strife weakened the Dúnedain and broke the land into three realms:"



"Rhudaur, the smallest and weakest of the Dúnedain kingships…"



"Cardolan, guardian of the ancient Barrow Downs,"



"where the forefathers of the Dúnedain lay entombed …"



"Now all of Angmar is united under the Iron Crown. Legions of orcs fight under the command of the Thrall Masters of Angmar."



"The great fortress at Carn Dum continues to rise, it will make an ideal sanctum for the Witch-king to work his fell sorcery."



"The hammer is forged at last, ready to smite the heirs of Elendil and lay their kingdoms low."



"Before Arnor can be invaded, the Witch-king needs a symbol to unite Angmar’s proud and willful denizens."



"Legends say that here in ages past loomed a great fortress of the ancient darkness, "



"its ruins dark and silent in the mountains."



"Rebuilding this bastion will secure the Iron Crown’s dominion over the Black Númenóreans and the northern troll tribes..."



"They are led by Hwaldar, a Hillchief in secret league with Angmar."



"Moving to crush this resistance, Argeleb has Hwaldar seized, and moves into Rhudaur."



"and he will seize it with both hands."



"King Argeleb is slain,"



"his hope for a unified North Kingdom shattered with his pride in the ruins of Rhudaur."



"Hwaldar takes his place as a leading commander serving the Iron Crown,"



"while his people provide more minions for the Thrall Masters."



"But despite their wounds, the Dúnedain are not without power."



"The fortified Weather Hills and fortress at Amon Sûl stand as a shield protecting Fornost and the heart of Arnor…"



"In the face of this gathering storm, King Argeleb of Arthedain reclaims the throne of all Arnor."



"Cardolan does not oppose him, but one faction of the Hillmen of Rhudaur begin to rebel."



"But Angmar, its power ready, advances into the weakest of the Dúnedain realms."



"Thus one man’s lust for power has given the Witch-king an opportunity…"



"Amon Sûl is laid to ruin."



"With its garrison reduced, the great bastion of the north could not withstand Angmar’s rage."



"But Angmar’s victory is not complete;"



"Arveleg  has escaped Amon Sûl with a prize that the Witch-king covets over all others…"



"The new king, Arveleg son of Argeleb, with the help of Cardolan and the Elves, has checked Angmar’s advance;"



" for many years they have held a frontier along the Weather Hills."



"Using the power of the Palantir of Amon Sûl, Arveleg has foiled every attack and stratagem."



"The Witch-king must now undertake a daring and dangerous strategy: a direct assault on the fortress of Amon Sûl."



"Diversionary attacks draw off the forces of Cardolan and the Elves, while the main army strikes the fortress."



"Although not the largest bastions in Middle-Earth, Amon Sûl is host to a mighty power – the master Palantir of the North."



"The shards of the Palantir still contain great power."



"For many centuries the Black Númenóreans have dabbled in the dark arts."



"Now these sorcerers have a focus to enhance and concentrate their power, unleashing a new terror upon Arnor."



"The fall of Amon Sûl is a terrible blow to the will of the Dúnedain."



"However, a brave band led by Arveleg has fled the fortress with the Palantir, heading back toward Fornost."



"Angered by its escape, the Witch-king dispatches the Lieutenant of Carn Dûm with orders to retrieve the stolen orb."



"The Witch-king orders his proven lieutenants, Hwaldar and Rogash, to seize the most sacred ground in Arnor, the Barrow Downs."



"Everywhere the armies of Angmar march, death and desolation follow."



"Cardolan has fallen, and all that remains is the realm of Arthedain. Men have allowed this to happen…"



"Their indecision and disunity have brought them to the brink of annihilation…"



"The destruction of Amon Sûl and its palantir crippled the Army of Arthedain, but Fornost still stands."



"The army and the people are prepared to defend the city to the bitter end."



"But the Witch-king cannot commit his army to a siege at Fornost with an enemy free to attack his rear."



"For the army of Cardolan was not at Amon Sûl, and is still in the field."



"A way must be devised to make them fight on ground of the Witch-king’s choosing."



"With the hallowed graves of their ancestors and kings at risk, Cardolan will be forced to battle."



"On these grounds Angmar can bleed them white, clearing the path for final victory."



"The Witch-king’s cunning matches his cruelty."



"The well-timed arrival of his lieutenants prevented a complete annihilation of his army."



"The Iron Crown has suffered a heavy blow, but Angmar has not been defeated …"



"It will take time to recover its strength… Perhaps enough time for Arnor to rise anew."



"But the Witch-king has no intention of allowing this to happen…"



"Arnor sits at the edge of the abyss. Rhudaur is the Witch-king’s, Cardolan is reduced to scattered bands of refugees."



"Only Fornost stands between Angmar and total domination of the North."



"Or so it appeared. The attack on Rivendell has united the Elven strongholds."



"Now, the Elves of Lindon, Rivendell and even Lórien march against Angmar."



"They are intent to drive a sword into the heart of Angmar that would last an age …"



"Though he fought with a valor rarely seen among men, the young Arnorian captain paid a price beyond death, and now serves the Iron Crown."



"Angmar’s great plague stretched far and wide, striking at the heart of Arnor and weakening the already fragile Dúnedain defenses."



"But the Witch-king will not be satisfied until Arnor lay buried in the bodies and blood of its youth."



"The Dúnedain of Arnor believe the Elven strike will provide them a chance to recover."



"Given time, Arnor can finish what the elves had started."



"But they reckon without knowledge of the depth of the Witch-king’s hatred…"



"He sends his sorcerers among the barrows of the great Arnor kings."



"While the desecration of this hallowed soil might break the hearts of men, the Witch-king has an even darker purpose:"



"to unleash a malevolent plague across the lands of men and elves."



"Angmar’s hammer fell, and down came Fornost, in ash and fire!"



"Arnor never wakes from its age-long nightmare; thousands lay dead in the streets."



"The Witch-king’s malice can now spread throughout these Northern Lands."



"Evil had come to Arnor… and evil prevailed."



"Many years have passed since the great plague devastated the North."



"In great secrecy the hosts of Angmar have been reforged, and the final stroke is ready to fall upon the last bastion of Arnor’s power: Fornost."



"With its beautiful spires and unyielding walls, it alone stands between the Witch-king and total victory."



"But the Dúnedain will not fall easily."



"They have gathered all of their host and all of their allies for this battle."



"The last and decisive battle for the North is about to begin...."



"The sharp spires of Mount Gundabad house several loosely allied tribes of orcs,"



"who dominate the scattered snow troll and goblin clans."



"In order for the Witch-king to defeat the realms of Arnor, he needs the blood and iron of Gundabad."



"But Angmar needs sword arms, not corpses."



"Therefore, he will win by guile that which force would destroy."



"A blade in the dark forces a gathering of the tribes to compete for the crown…"



"To this gathering, the Witch-king sends his most fearsome lieutenant, Rogash, Troll of the North,"



"to ensure that the orcs of Gundabad will heed the orders of the Iron Crown…"



" Through the power and savagery of Rogash, Mount Gundabad has yielded."



"Now, legions of orcs fight under the command of the Thrall Masters of Angmar."

Nimrodel desired peace, and knowing she would no longer find it in Middle-earth, said to Amroth that they could marry if he took her to a tranquil land. Amroth agreed, and they traveled south to find passage towards the Undying Lands. However, they became separated, and Amroth reached the havens of Edhellond before Nimrodel. Long he waited, until one fateful night his ship was born away in a storm as far as Tol Eressëa. In despair, Amroth leapt over the bow, wishing to swim back to shore and his fair Nimrodel, but sadly drowned in the attempt. \n Left click icon then left click on target area"

"... To reclaim Khazad-dûm, the ancient halls of their ancestors ..."

"Balin has reclaimed the Dimrill Gate for Erebor! But his story has just begun ..."



"... Into the black pit of Moria we must go to rekindle the great braziers of our folk, and reclaim what was lost."



"Óin: We have secured the First Hall! Now we will take back our ancient Kingdom and slay the foul enemy within!"



"Balin: Stay alert. These dark halls might be home to more than just orcs..."



"Óin: Let's settle down here for now and gather strength. We will send word to Dáin once we have secured a point of defence."



"Balin: The gate is locked tight. We must find a Key to open it and continue onwards."

"Dwarf: Whatever lurks beneath these waters, we must keep going!"



"Óin: We cannot go on much further, cousin. Many are wounded. \n We must etablish a foothold now, so that in time we may venture further."

"Colony: All hail Balin, son of Fundin! Lord of Khazad-dûm! \n Hurrah! Hurrah for Balin!"



"Soon afterwards The Dwarves recovered their strength and settled the Twenty-first Hall. \n Balin mustered his kin to begin clear out the western mines and halls of the vile orcish usurpers ..."



"Many wondrous artifacts were recovered. The Dwarves of Balin's Colony donned the armour of their forebears, hard and tough like a dragon's hide. \n Scores of orcs were killed, cut down relentlessly by the fury of the Dwarves ..."



"Balin's Colony grew. The Dwarves began to venture deep within their ancient halls, driving the orcs before them wherever they were found... \n Until at last they reached the West-gate, known as the Doors of Durin ..."



"The Lord of Moria discovered ancient treasures: Durin's Axe, and a truesilver helmet of untold age ..."



"Every find was catalogued in the Book of Mazarbul. For five years they fought and ventured, slowly gaining ground... \n Until, during the fifth year, their luck had run out."



"Lord Balin wrote a stack of letters, to be sent to Longbeard strongholds across Middle-earth:\n Khazad-dûm had been reclaimed, and would remain secure if more settlers were to arrive."



"Ere he sent out this request, Balin traveled to the Mirrormere to quietly reflect upon his quest."



"Balin: Ah ... the sun still shines in gold and silver upon the stones of the Dimrill Dale, as it did in the days of Durin..."



"He looked into the waters, saw Durin's Crown above ... \n And then he saw no more."



"A lone goblin scout killed Balin with a single arrow. Balin, son of Fundin, was slain."



"Nothing could be done. \n 'Leaderless!', the goblin scout reported. 'The Dwarves are leaderless!'"



"Soon an army of orcs appeared at the Dimrill Gate. There were many Trolls amongst their numbers. The assault upon Balin's Colony soon began ..."



"The Dwarves, armed with steel and furious grief, resolved to avenge their lord \n Each Dwarf fought with the strength of three, and stopped the orcs in their tracks. But the orcs kept coming ..."



"The orcish horde breached the barricade and stormed the First Hall. Many Dwarves lay dead in their wake. \n Balin's corpse was recovered, and was set into a tomb in the Chamber of Mazarbul."



"Dwarf Officer: Óin, you have arrived in time! \n They have breached our defences! They are coming for us in great number!"



"Óin: This colony must not be lost! Khazâd ai-mênu!"



"Óin: We cannot hold them here! \n Fall back to the Chamber of Mazarbul!"



"Ori: We will fortify the Chamber of Mazarbul and wait. Go swiftly Lord Óin!"



"Dwarf: It is Durin's Bane! It comes for us! Flee for your lives!"



"Escape to the Chamber of Mazarbul"



"Óin: The water... it has risen high in our absence..."



"Dwarf Officer: Óin! There is movement in the water! Watch out!"



"Óin: Grasping arms! Death lies inside the waters! We cannot flee! We must slay this beast and find a way forward!"



"Dwarf: No! It has slain Óin! we must flee back to the Chamber of Mazarbul! The end of days is upon us!"



"Dwarf: My lord Ori, the hammer of our doom has struck! Óin is dead!"



"In T.A. 2994, Balin's Colony was destroyed. No word reached Dáin Ironfoot.\n It would be yet another 30 years before the Company of the Ring passed through and discovered their fate..."
